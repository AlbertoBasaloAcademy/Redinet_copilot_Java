# Design Technical Solution and Define Implementation Guidelines

## Task

Design the high-level technical solution and define the implementation guidelines based on the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## Context

- [PRD.md](/docs/PRD.md) for current project requirements
- [STRUCTURE.md](/docs/STRUCTURE.md) if there is a previous architecture documentation
- [docs](/docs/**.md) folder for any existing documentation

### IMPORTANT

If this is a _brownfield_ project, consider the following:

- **Current implementation**: Review existing codebase and architecture to understand current design decisions and constraints.

- **Current STRUCTURE**: If this project has a previous STRUCTURE document, review it for existing architecture and guidelines, and update it as needed.

## Steps

1. Define 
  - technical stack, 
  - architecture patterns,
  - development workflow.
2. Identify 
  - repository structure,
  - development infrastructure.
3. Write (create or update) them in a formal document at [/docs/STRUCTURE.md](/docs/STRUCTURE.md)

## Validation

- Ensure the STRUCTURE document includes:
  - [ ] Development: Technical Stack and Development Workflow
  - [ ] Architecture: Folder Structure and Components Diagram
